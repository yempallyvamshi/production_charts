Monthly Production Visualization
This project visualizes monthly production data using Python and Matplotlib. It generates 12 subplots (one for each month) showing production trends over days, with separate lines for different levels (e.g., L1, L2).

Features

Monthly Subplots: 12 subplots in a single frame, one for each month.

Level Separation: Different lines for each level (L1, L2).

Readable Formatting: Month names (e.g., Jan, Feb) instead of numbers, and rotated x-axis labels to avoid overlapping.
